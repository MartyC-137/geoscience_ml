This is the github repository to accompany my blog post on Towards Data Science, 
'Exploring use cases of machine learning in the geosciences'. In this project, I used
the regional geochemical survey dataset (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/49a73c36-4a25-4be5-b6d1-abd020fb031a)
to predict certain stratigraphy of the 'Quest' region of British Columbia with 71% accuracy, and I also used the dataset 
to predict concentration of certain analytes from all other analytes.
